# nwlattice
This package is for generating atom coorinates that can be used to initialize structures in atomistic simulations of nanowires.
It's written to work with the `read_data` command in [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/) and output files can be visualized in, for example, [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/).

## Installation
